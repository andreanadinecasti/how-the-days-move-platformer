# 🌙 How the Days Move

*“A quiet little world where time drips slowly, one dreamlike step at a time.”*

Welcome to **How the Days Move**, a 1-bit platformer about wandering through a strange, peaceful sewer-world. Each level represents a day in the life of a small character — the first of which is **Monday**. Floaty jumps, locked doors, mysterious keys, and gentle ambience guide players through a journey that feels more like memory than mission.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Feel

- **Floaty + Dreamlike**:  
  The movement is soft and surreal — acceleration and gravity are tuned to feel like you're underwater or in a dream.

```
acceleration = 9
max speed = 11
jump height = 3
down gravity = 1
jump duration = 4
```

- **Camera**:  
Horizontal-only scrolling that starts once you reach the middle of the screen. No vertical movement — you're grounded in the flow.

## 🎨 Visual Style

- Using the beautiful **1-Bit Platformer Pack** by [Kenney Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets).
- Particle effects will come from the **Kenney Particle Pack** (or possibly custom effects later).
- Swapping between transparent and packed tilemaps to create a layered, clean aesthetic.

## 🔊 Sound Design

- Peaceful. Ambient. Quiet.  
Think lo-fi puddles, soft footsteps, and calm drips — still choosing final sounds, but all audio will support a meditative, cozy experience.
- All assets will be **royalty-free**, possibly from freesound.org or similar libraries (non-Kenney).

## 🧩 Level Design: Monday

- The world is mysterious and a bit sewage-like — but safe.
- Collect:
- 🗝️ **Keys** to unlock doors (required to progress)
- 💰 **Coins** (optional, tricky to reach — adds score)
- ❤️ **Hearts** (extra lives, tucked in risky spots)

- Finish the level by navigating past obstacles and reaching a special **exit platform** — a mirror of the starting one.

## 🎯 Goal

Each level = one day.  
There are 7 total — a soft narrative unfolds as you move through the week. Not loud or spelled out, just *felt*.
