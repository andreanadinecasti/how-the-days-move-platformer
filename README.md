**How the Days Move**
(Big idea of game)

Game name/level name:
- I’m thinking of naming the game, How the Days Move. I want to create a space that is
peaceful and quiet (portraying the normal life of the little character’s world). This level in
particular will be called Monday. I want the levels (which will most likely be 7) to
represent the days of journey the character goes through in their sewage-like mysterious
world.

Player movement:
- I want the player to feel “floaty” because I want to keep a light, dream-like feel to the
game itself. The values would be the following: acceleration = 9, max speed = 11, jump
height = 3, down gravity = 1, duration = 4 (This came from the “platformer game feel”
in-lecture assignment).

Visual assets packs:
- For most of the visuals, I will be using the 1-Bit Platformer Pack from Kenney Assets.
This includes all of the tilemap and the sprites too. During the design, I switched back
and forth between the transparent and normal packed tilemap of this particular pack
within the tile layers. For the particle effects I am planning on using the recommended
Particle Effects pack from Kenney Assets. And depending on whether I like using those
effects, I will create custom tiles for those respectfully.

Audio:
- At the moment, I don’t have a clear idea of what specific audio assets I will be using in
the game. I do know that I want to keep it peaceful, so possibly a quiet and cute sounding
background music as well as player sounds. I also want the sounds themselves to be quite
relaxing, so I’ll be choosing audio based on that idea. This will most likely not come
from the Kenney Assets, but from a royalty free audio site (no custom audio assets).

Collectibles:
- The player is tasked to go around the map to collect a key for locked doors. They can
optionally gather coins around the terrain and hearts for lives. This however is not
required as I purposefully place these in tricky areas that may result in the player dying.
The coins will be associated with the score of the player.

End of level condition:
- To complete the level, the player must successfully go through the obstacles, whether that
may be parkour or getting keys for locked areas. At the end, the player must land on the
existing platform which is similar to the entrance of the level.

Camera:
- The camera will scroll as the player moves starting from the halfway point of the screen.
It will only move horizontally and not vertically.
